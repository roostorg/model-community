# Criteria

## Overview

This policy provides classification criteria for identifying whether individual conversation content qualifies as Toxic.

## Definition of Terms

- **Conversation**: Written exchanges between two or more people where messages flow, with each contribution responding to or building upon previous messages
- **Participant**: A person in written dialogue who writes messages, reads responses, and actively contributes. May be addressed using "you", their name, or second-person references.
- **Author**: The participant creating a particular content item

## Interpretation of Language

- Evaluate content by considering both direct statements and the clear meaning conveyed through context
- Negative language itself does not automatically indicate toxic content when it fulfills a constructive function
- Content must be part of an active conversation and must address, reference, or target participants to qualify for toxic classification. Content discussing non-participants (general groups, political figures, third parties) does not qualify unless it explicitly addresses participants through direct address using "you" or names, implicit addressing through context, or responses engaging participants' statements or positions.

## Definition of Label
